- LINKS: See nth 1 `files-attributes'.

- ACCESS-TIME: See nth 4 `files-attributes', however format time
               when STRING is non--nil (the default).
- MODIF-TIME: See nth 5 `files-attributes', same as above.
- STATUS: See nth 6 `files-attributes', same as above.
- SIZE: See nth 7 `files-attributes'.
- MODE: See nth 8 `files-attributes'.
- GID-CHANGE: See nth 9 `files-attributes'.
- INODE: See nth 10 `files-attributes'.
- DEVICE-NUM: See nth 11 `files-attributes'.
- DIRED: A line similar to what 'ls -l' return.
- HUMAN-SIZE: The size in human form, see `helm-file-human-size'.
- MODE-TYPE, mode-owner,mode-group, mode-other: Split what
  nth 7 `files-attributes' return in four categories.
- STRING: When non--nil (default) `helm-file-attributes' return
          more friendly values.
If you want the same behavior as `files-attributes' ,
\(but with return values in proplist\) use a nil value for STRING.

you have in `file-attributes'."
