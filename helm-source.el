;; Interface to create helm sources easily.
;; Actually the eieo objects are transformed in alist for compatibility.
;; In the future this package should allow creating source as eieo objects
;; without conversion to alist, teaching helm to read such a structure.
;; The compatibility with alists would be kept.
