Only the elements of COLLECTION that satisfy PREDICATE are considered.

Argument POINT is the same as in `completion-all-completions' and

The return value is a list of completions that may be sorted by
the sort function provided by the completion-style in
use (emacs-27 only), otherwise (emacs-26) the sort function has
to be provided if needed either with an FCT function in source or
by passing the sort function with METADATA
E.g.: (metadata (display-sort-function . foo)).

If you don't want the sort fn provided by style to kick
in (emacs-27) you can use as metadata value the symbol `nosort'.

Example:

    (helm :sources (helm-build-sync-source \"test\"

When STYLES is specified use these `completion-styles', see
