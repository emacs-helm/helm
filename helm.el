  "* Helm Generic Help

\\<helm-map>`helm' is an Emacs framework for incremental
completions and narrowing selections.

Helm narrows the list of candidates as the pattern is typed and
updates the list in a live feedback. Helm accepts multiple
patterns (entered with a space between patterns). Helm uses
familiar Emacs navigation keys to move up and down the list.
`RET' selects the candidate from the list.

** Helm Help

C-h m\t\tShows this generic Helm help.

** Shortcuts For nth Action

f1-12: Execute nth Action where n is 1 to 12.

** Shortcuts for executing Default Action on the nth candidate

C-x <n> => executes default action on number <n> candidate before currently selected candidate.

C-c <n> => executes default action on number <n> candidate after current selected candidate.

n is limited only to 1 through 9. For larger jumps use other
navigation keys. Also note that Helm candidates list by default
do not display line numbers. Line numbers can be enabled with the
linum-relative package.

** Visible Marks

Visible marks are displayed next to selected candidates, if any.
Some Helm actions operate on marked candidates.

** Frequently Used Commands

\\[helm-toggle-resplit-and-swap-windows]\t\tToggle vertical/horizontal split on first hit and swap helm window on second hit.
\\[helm-quit-and-find-file]\t\tDrop into `helm-find-files'.
\\[helm-kill-selection-and-quit]\t\tKill display value of candidate and quit (with prefix arg, kill the real value).
\\[helm-yank-selection]\t\tYank current selection into pattern.
\\[helm-follow-mode]\t\tToggle automatic execution of persistent action.
\\[helm-follow-action-forward]\tRun persistent action and then select next line.
\\[helm-follow-action-backward]\t\tRun persistent action and then select previous line.
\\[helm-refresh]\t\tRecalculate and redisplay candidates.
\\[helm-toggle-suspend-update]\t\tSuspend/reenable updates to candidates list.

** Global Commands

\\<global-map>\\[helm-resume] revives the last `helm' session.
Very useful for resuming previous Helm. Binding a key to this
command will greatly improve `helm' interactivity especially
after an accidental exit.

  "Main function to execute helm sources.

Keywords supported:
:sources :input :prompt :resume :preselect
:buffer :keymap :default :history :allow-nest

Extra LOCAL-VARS keywords are supported, see below.

PLIST is a list like \(:key1 val1 :key2 val2 ...\) or
\(&optional sources input prompt resume
            preselect buffer keymap default history\).

Basic keywords are the following:

\:sources

A list of sources used for this session.  It also accepts a
symbol, interpreted as a variable of a helm source
i.e (a symbol can be passed instead of a list of sources).
It also accepts an alist representing a helm source, which is
detected by \(assq 'name ANY-SOURCES\).
NOTE: In this case the source is embedded in the helm command and
have no symbol name, so it is not reachable from outside.
It will be referenced in `helm-sources' as a whole alist.

\:input

Temporary value of `helm-pattern', ie. initial input of minibuffer.

\:prompt

Prompt other than \"pattern: \".

\:resume

If t, Resurrect previously instance of `helm'.  Skip the initialization.
If 'noresume, this instance of `helm' cannot be resumed.

\:preselect

Initially selected candidate.  Specified by exact candidate or a regexp.

\:buffer

`helm-buffer' instead of *helm*.

\:keymap

`helm-map' for current `helm' session.

\:default

A default argument that will be inserted in minibuffer \ with
\\<minibuffer-local-map>\\[next-history-element]. When nil or not
present `thing-at-point' will be used instead. If
`helm--maybe-use-default-as-input' is non-`nil' display will be
updated using :default arg as input unless :input is specified,
which in this case will take precedence over :default. This is a
string or a list. If list, car of the list becomes initial
default input. \\<minibuffer-local-map>\\[next-history-element]
cycles through the list items.

\:history

Minibuffer input, by default, is pushed to `minibuffer-history'.
When an argument HISTORY is provided, input is pushed to
HISTORY. The HISTORY element should be a valid symbol.

\:allow-nest

Allow running this helm command in a running helm session.

Standard arguments are supported. These two are the same:

\(helm :sources sources :input input :prompt prompt :resume resume
       :preselect preselect :buffer buffer :keymap keymap :default default
       :history history\)

and

\(helm sources input prompt resume preselect buffer keymap default history\)

are the same for now. However, the use of non-keyword args is
deprecated and should not be used.

Other keywords are interpreted as local variables of this helm
session. The `helm-' prefix can be omitted. For example,

\(helm :sources 'helm-source-buffers-list
       :buffer \"*buffers*\" :candidate-number-limit 10\)

starts helm session with `helm-source-buffers' source in
*buffers* buffer and sets variable `helm-candidate-number-limit'
to 10 as a session local variable.

  "The top level function used to store candidates in `helm-source-in-buffer'.

Candidates are stored in a buffer generated internally by
`helm-candidate-buffer' function. Each candidate must be placed
in one line. This function is meant to be used in
candidates-in-buffer or candidates attribute of an helm source.
It is especially fast for many (1000+) candidates.

The buffer is created and fed in the init attribute function of helm.

e.g:

     (helm-build-in-buffer-source \"test\"
       :init (lambda ()
               (helm-init-candidates-in-buffer
                   'global '(foo foa fob bar baz))))

A shortcut can be used to simplify:

     (helm-build-in-buffer-source \"test\"
       :data '(foo foa fob bar baz))

`candidates-in-buffer' is now deprecated in favor of
`helm-source-in-buffer' class.

Description provided here for backward compatibility.

By default, `helm' makes candidates by evaluating the
candidates function, then narrows them by `string-match' for each
candidate.

But this is slow for large number of candidates. The new way is
to store all candidates in a buffer and then narrow with
`re-search-forward'. Search function is customizable by search
attribute. The important point is that buffer processing is MUCH
FASTER than string list processing and is the Emacs way.

The init function writes all candidates to a newly-created
candidate buffer.  The candidates buffer is created or specified
by `helm-candidate-buffer'.  Candidates are stored in a line.

The candidates function narrows all candidates, IOW creates a
subset of candidates dynamically. It is the task of
`helm-candidates-in-buffer'.  As long as
`helm-candidate-buffer' is used,`(candidates-in-buffer)' is
sufficient in most cases.

Note that `(candidates-in-buffer)' is shortcut of three attributes:
  (candidates . helm-candidates-in-buffer)
  (volatile)
  (match identity)
And `(candidates-in-buffer . func)' is shortcut of three attributes:
  (candidates . func)
  (volatile)
  (match identity)
The expansion is performed in `helm-get-sources'.

The `candidates-in-buffer' attribute implies the volatile attribute.
The volatile attribute is needed because `helm-candidates-in-buffer'
creates candidates dynamically and need to be called every time
`helm-pattern' changes.

Because `helm-candidates-in-buffer' plays the role of `match' attribute
function, specifying `(match identity)' makes the source slightly faster.

However if source contains `match-part' attribute, match is computed only
on part of candidate returned by the call of function provided by this attribute.
The function should have one arg, candidate, and return only
a specific part of candidate.

To customize `helm-candidates-in-buffer' behavior, use `search',
`get-line' and `match-part' attributes."

  "Execute persistent action every time the cursor is moved when enabled.
This mode enabled for the current source only; for next source,
this mode will have to be enabled again. This mode can be enabled
or disabled interactively at anytime during a helm session. It
can also be enabled specifically for a source by adding the
`follow' attribute to the source. Even with 'follow' attribute, a
source can be interactively disabled or enabled. Note that when
interactively disabled when `follow' attribute exists, next helm
session will continue to keep the `helm-follow-mode' disabled. To
avoid this, set `follow' attribute for the source in
`helm-before-initialize-hook'.

e.g:

\(add-hook 'helm-before-initialize-hook
          (lambda () (helm-attrset 'follow 1 helm-source-buffers-list)))

This will enable `helm-follow-mode' automatically in `helm-source-buffers-list'.

`helm-attrset' will only work if the `helm-source' object is already properly initialized.
Many of the `helm-source' objects are lazily initialized (or set to `nil` at load time),
so adding these hooks in your `~/.emacs' (or equivalent) will cause helm to error.
