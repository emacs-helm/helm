A list of sources used for this session.  It also accepts a
symbol, interpreted as a variable of a helm source
i.e (a symbol can be passed instead of a list of sources).
It also accepts an alist representing a helm source, which is
detected by \(assq 'name ANY-SOURCES\).
NOTE: In this case the source is embedded in the helm command and
have no symbol name, so it is not reachable from outside.
It will be referenced in `helm-sources' as a whole alist.

\:input

Temporary value of `helm-pattern', ie. initial input of minibuffer.

\:prompt

Prompt other than \"pattern: \".

\:resume

If t, Resurrect previously instance of `helm'.  Skip the initialization.
If 'noresume, this instance of `helm' cannot be resumed.

\:preselect

Initially selected candidate.  Specified by exact candidate or a regexp.

\:buffer

`helm-buffer' instead of *helm*.

\:keymap

`helm-map' for current `helm' session.

\:default

A default argument that will be inserted in minibuffer \
with \\<minibuffer-local-map>\\[next-history-element].
When nil or not present `thing-at-point' will be used instead.
If `helm-maybe-use-default-as-input' is non--nil display will be
updated using :default arg as input unless :input is specified,
which in this case will take precedence on :default
This is a string or a list, in this case the car of the list will
be used as initial default input, but you will be able to cycle in this
list with \\<minibuffer-local-map>\\[next-history-element].

\:history

By default all minibuffer input is pushed to `minibuffer-history',
if an argument HISTORY is provided, input will be pushed to HISTORY.
History element should be a symbol.

\:allow-nest

Allow running this helm command within a running helm session.

Of course, conventional arguments are supported, the two are same.

\(helm :sources sources :input input :prompt prompt :resume resume
       :preselect preselect :buffer buffer :keymap keymap :default default
       :history history\)

and

\(helm sources input prompt resume preselect buffer keymap default history\)

are the same.

However the use of non keyword args is deprecated and should not be used.

Other keywords are interpreted as local variables of this helm session.
The `helm-' prefix can be omitted.  For example,

\(helm :sources 'helm-source-buffers-list
       :buffer \"*buffers*\" :candidate-number-limit 10\)

means starting helm session with `helm-source-buffers'
source in *buffers* buffer and set variable `helm-candidate-number-limit'
to 10 as session local variable.

  "Get candidates from the candidates buffer according to `helm-pattern'.

BUFFER is `helm-candidate-buffer' by default.  Each
candidate must be placed in one line.  This function is meant to
be used in candidates-in-buffer or candidates attribute of an
helm source.  Especially fast for many (1000+) candidates.

eg.
 '((name . \"many files\")
   (init . (lambda () (with-current-buffer (helm-candidate-buffer 'local)
                        (insert-many-filenames))))

   (candidates-in-buffer)
   (type . file))

+===============================================================+
| The new way of making and narrowing candidates: Using buffers |
+===============================================================+

By default, `helm' makes candidates by evaluating the
candidates function, then narrows them by `string-match' for each
candidate.

But this way is very slow for many candidates. The new way is
storing all candidates in a buffer and narrowing them by
`re-search-forward'. Search function is customizable by search
attribute. The important point is that buffer processing is MUCH
FASTER than string list processing and is the Emacs way.

The init function writes all candidates to a newly-created
candidate buffer.  The candidates buffer is created or specified
by `helm-candidate-buffer'.  Candidates are stored in a line.

The candidates function narrows all candidates, IOW creates a
subset of candidates dynamically. It is the task of
`helm-candidates-in-buffer'.  As long as
`helm-candidate-buffer' is used,`(candidates-in-buffer)' is
sufficient in most cases.

Note that `(candidates-in-buffer)' is shortcut of three attributes:
  (candidates . helm-candidates-in-buffer)
  (volatile)
  (match identity)
And `(candidates-in-buffer . func)' is shortcut of three attributes:
  (candidates . func)
  (volatile)
  (match identity)
The expansion is performed in `helm-get-sources'.

The candidates-in-buffer attribute implies the volatile attribute.
The volatile attribute is needed because `helm-candidates-in-buffer'
creates candidates dynamically and need to be called everytime
`helm-pattern' changes.

Because `helm-candidates-in-buffer' plays the role of `match' attribute
function, specifying `(match identity)' makes the source slightly faster.

However if source contain match-part attribute, match is computed only
on part of candidate returned by the call of function provided by this attribute.
The function should have one arg, candidate, and return only
a specific part of candidate.

To customize `helm-candidates-in-buffer' behavior, use `search',
`get-line', `match-part' and `search-from-end' attributes."

The mode is enabled for the current source only, you will have to turn it

attribute to this source.
Even when the attribute `follow' exists in source, it is still possible
to disable/enable this mode interactively.

`helm-follow-mode' will be disabled on next helm session even if `follow'
