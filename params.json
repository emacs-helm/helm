It will help steer you in the right direction when you're looking\r\nfor stuff in Emacs (like buffers, files, etc).\r\n\r\nHelm is a fork of `anything.el` originaly written by Tamas Patrovic\r\nand can be considered to be its successor. \r\n`Helm` sets out to clean up the legacy code in `anything.el`\r\nand provide a cleaner, leaner and more modular tool, that's not tied in\r\nthe trap of backward compatibility. \r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n### Quick install\r\n\r\n  1. Clone the `helm` repository to some directory:\r\n  \r\n    ```elisp\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm.git /path/to/helm/directory\r\n    ```\r\n  \r\n  2. Run make from this directory.\r\n  3. Add to `.emacs.el` (or equivalent):\r\n\r\n    ```elisp\r\n    (add-to-list 'load-path \"/path/to/helm/directory\")\r\n    (require 'helm-config)\r\n    ```\r\nAlternatively, you can have a quick try to helm by launching from the helm directory:\r\n\r\n`./emacs-helm.sh`\r\n\r\nNote that this will not work on Windows systems.\r\n\r\n### Install from Emacs packaging system\r\n\r\nHelm is now available on Melpa at `http://melpa.milkbox.net/`\r\nYou will find there instructions to install.\r\n\r\n**Note to Linux Distributions Maintainers**\r\n\r\n`Only the extensions present in the github emacs-helm organisation are supported.`\r\n\r\n### Emacs Prelude\r\n\r\nIf you're afraid to play with Emacs's configuration, but want to try\r\nout Helm - have no fear. Have a look at\r\n[Emacs Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) - it has\r\nHelm built-in and properly set-up.\r\n\r\n### Basic usage\r\n\r\nJust type `M-x helm-mini` and enjoy. You might want to bind that command to\r\na keyboard shortcut. Here's a suggestion:\r\n\r\n```elisp\r\n(global-set-key (kbd \"C-c h\") 'helm-mini)\r\n```\r\nYou can also start with `M-x helm-mode` and enjoy helm completion in your favourites\r\nEmacs commands (e.g 'M-x', 'C-x C-f', etc...).\r\nYou can enable this by adding in your init file:\r\n\r\n```elisp\r\n(helm-mode 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a startup point you can also look at the helm section in Emacs menu to\r\ndiscover some of the commands provided by helm.\r\n\r\n### Advanced usage\r\n\r\nHelm is capable of a lot.\r\nYou can find all the gory details on the [Helm Wiki](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/wiki).\r\n\r\n## Known issues\r\n\r\nCheck out the project's\r\n[issue list](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open)\r\na list of unresolved issues. By the way - feel free to fix any of them\r\nand sent us a pull request. :-)\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\nHere's a [list](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/contributors) of all the people who have contributed to the\r\ndevelopment of Helm.\r\n\r\n## Bugs & Improvements\r\n\r\nBug reports and suggestions for improvements are always\r\nwelcome. GitHub pull requests are even better! :-)\r\n\r\n### Report bug or need help\r\n\r\n[emacs helm mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/emacs-helm)\r\n\r\n### Send Bug Report from Emacs\r\n\r\nIf you have problems, send a bug report via `C-c C-x C-b` in helm session (best)\r\nor `M-x helm-send-bug-report` outside helm session.\r\nWe implemented this bug report feature because we want to know your current state.\r\nIt helps usa solve problems easily.\r\nThe steps are:\r\n\r\n  1. Setup mail in Emacs, the easiest way is:\r\n  \r\n    ```elisp\r\n    (setq user-mail-address \"your@mail.address\")\r\n    (setq user-full-name \"Your Full Name\")\r\n    (setq smtpmail-smtp-server \"your.smtp.server.jp\")\r\n    (setq mail-user-agent 'message-user-agent)\r\n    (setq message-send-mail-function 'message-smtpmail-send-it)\r\n    ```\r\n  \r\n  2. Be sure to use the **LATEST** version of `helm.el`.\r\n  3. Enable debugger. `M-x toggle-debug-on-error` or `(setq debug-on-error t)`\r\n  4. Use Lisp version instead of compiled one: `(load \"helm.el\")`\r\n  5. Do it!\r\n  6. If you got an error, please do not close _*Backtrace*_ buffer.\r\n  7. Type `C-c C-x C-b` (helm session, best!)\r\n     or `M-x helm-send-bug-report` (outside) and\r\n     then `M-x insert-buffer` *Backtrace* (if you got error)\r\n  8. Describe the bug using a precise recipe.\r\n  9. Type `C-c C-c` to send.\r\n\r\nCheers,<br>\r\nThe Helm Team\r\n\r\n<!-- OpenDNS button -->\r\n<a title=\"Use OpenDNS to make your Internet faster, safer, and smarter.\" href=\"http://www.opendns.com/share/\"><img src=\"http://images.opendns.com/buttons/use_opendns_155x52.gif\" width=\"155\" height=\"52\" style=\"border:0;\" alt=\"Use OpenDNS\" /></a>\r\n<!-- / end OpenDNS button -->","note":"Don't delete this file!
