  <b>Helm</b> is an Emacs framework for incremental completions and narrowing
  selections. It provides an easy-to-use API for developers wishing to build
  their own Helm applications in Emacs, powerful search tools and dozens of
  already built-in commands providing completion to almost everything.
  It is a must-have for anyone using Emacs as a main work environment.
  Helm has been widely adopted by many Emacs power-users.
  It is available in Melpa and can be easily installed from the Emacs package manager.

  Currently Thierry Volpiatto is (mostly) the only one still maintaining Helm (<a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2018/09/interview-with-thierry-volpiatto/">a interview</a> with him).
  
  This is a lot of work which Thierry have done freely since 2011. It takes a lot of his time and starts to be more and more difficult
  maintaining it without financial help. Due to that, the development of Helm is stalled and in maintenance mode by now. 
  If you, and other 59 users, are reading this post now, and did the same thing, then the fundraiser should be done in 1 day and the Helm development can resume.
  If you feel Helm is making your daily work easier, please consider making a donation. Perhaps for a price of a cup of coffee for each month, you can make this a recurring donation? <a href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/tvolpiatto">Support via Paypal</a> or <a href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/tvolpiatto">support via Liberapay</a>.

  Thank you! â€” Helm Community
