\nTips:

Completion:

You can enter a partial name of major-mode (e.g lisp, sh) to narrow down buffers.
Enter then a space and a pattern to narrow down to buffers matching this pattern.
If you enter a space and a pattern prefixed by \"@\" helm will search for text matching
this pattern INSIDE the buffer (i.e not in the name of buffer).
NOTE that if you enter your pattern prefixed with \"@\" but escaped, helm will search a buffer
matching \"@pattern\" but will not search inside.

e.g

if I enter in pattern prompt:
\"lisp ^helm @moc\"
helm will narrow down the list by selecting only buffers that are in lisp mode, start by helm
and match \"moc\" in their contents.

if I enter in pattern prompt:
\"lisp ^helm moc\"
Notice there is no \"@\" this time
helm will look for lisp mode buffers starting by \"helm\" and have \"moc\" in their name.

Creating buffers

When creating a new buffer use \\[universal-argument] to choose a mode for your buffer in a list.
This list is customizable, see `helm-buffers-favorite-modes'.

Meaning of colors and prefixes for buffers:

Remote buffers are prefixed with '@'.
Red        => Buffer have its file modified on disk by an external process.
Indianred2 => Buffer exists but its file have been deleted.
Orange     => Buffer is modified and its file not saved to disk.
Italic     => A non--file buffer.

\nSpecific commands for `helm-buffers-list':
\\<helm-buffer-map>
\\[helm-buffer-run-zgrep]\t\t->Grep Buffer(s) works as zgrep too (C-u grep all buffers but non--file buffers).

\nTips:
\n- Enter `~/' at end of pattern to quickly reach home directory.
- Enter `/' at end of pattern to quickly reach root of your file system.
- Enter `./' at end of pattern to quickly reach `default-directory' (initial start of session).
- You can complete with partial basename \(e.g \"fb\" will complete \"foobar\"\).
- Use `C-u C-z' to watch an image.
- To browse images directories turn on `helm-follow-mode' and navigate with arrow keys.
- When entered ediff, hitting `C-g' will ask you to use locate to find the file to ediff with.
- You can switch to locate with `C-x C-f', with one prefix arg use locale db file or create it,
  with two prefix arg create or refresh db file.
- When you want to delete backward characters to e.g creating a new file or directory,
  autoupdate may keep updating to an existent directory
  preventing you to do so, in this case just hit C-<backspace> and then <backspace>.
- You can create a new directory an a new file at the same time, just write the path in prompt
  and press <RET>.
  e.g You can create \"~/new/newnew/newnewnew/my_newfile.txt\".
- To create a new directory, add a \"/\" at end of new name and press <RET>.
- To create a new file just write the filename not ending with \"/\".
- You can start a recursive search with Locate of Find (See commands below).
  With Locate you can use a local db with a prefix arg; If the localdb doesn't already
  exists, you will be prompted for its creation, if it exists and you want to refresh it,
  give two prefix args.

\nTips:

- Passing extra args after filename:

Normally your command or alias will be called with file as argument.

e.g <command> 'candidate_file'

But you can also pass an argument or more after 'candidate_file' like this:

<command> %s [extra_args]\n

'candidate_file' will be inserted at '%s' and your command will look at this:

<command> 'candidate_file' [extra_args]

- Specify many files as args (marked files):

e.g <command> file1 file2 ...

Call `helm-find-files-eshell-command-on-file' with one prefix-arg 
Otherwise you can pass one prefix-arg from the command selection buffer.

With two prefix-arg before starting or from the command selection buffer
the output is printed to your `current-buffer'.

With no prefix-arg or a prefix-arg value of '(16) (C-u C-u) the command
is called once for each file like this:

<command> file1 <command> file2 etc...

(helm-document-attribute 'name "mandatory"
  "  The name of the source. It is also the heading which appears
  above the list of matches from the source. Must be unique.")

(helm-document-attribute 'header-name "optional"
  "  A function returning the display string of the header. Its
  argument is the name of the source. This attribute is useful to
  add an additional information with the source name.")

(helm-document-attribute 'candidates "mandatory if candidates-in-buffer attribute is not provided"
  "  Specifies how to retrieve candidates from the source. It can
  either be a variable name, a function called with no parameters
  or the actual list of candidates.

  The list must be a list whose members are strings, symbols
  or (DISPLAY . REAL) pairs.

  In case of (DISPLAY . REAL) pairs, the DISPLAY string is shown
  in the Helm buffer, but the REAL one is used as action
  argument when the candidate is selected. This allows a more
  readable presentation for candidates which would otherwise be,
  for example, too long or have a common part shared with other
  candidates which can be safely replaced with an abbreviated
  string for display purposes.

  Note that if the (DISPLAY . REAL) form is used then pattern
  matching is done on the displayed string, not on the real
  value.

  If the candidates have to be retrieved asynchronously (for
  example, by an external command which takes a while to run)
  then the function should start the external command
  asynchronously and return the associated process object.
  Helm will take care of managing the process (receiving the
  output from it, killing it if necessary, etc.). The process
  should return candidates matching the current pattern (see
  variable `helm-pattern'.)
  You should use instead `candidates-process' attribute for
  async processes, a warning will popup when using async process
  in a `candidates' attribute.

  Note that currently results from asynchronous sources appear
  last in the helm buffer regardless of their position in
  `helm-sources'.")

(helm-document-attribute 'candidates-process
    "Same as `candidates' attributes but for process function."
  "You should use this attribute when using a function involving
  an async process instead of `candidates'.")

(helm-document-attribute 'action "mandatory if type attribute is not provided"
  "  It is a list of (DISPLAY . FUNCTION) pairs or FUNCTION.
  FUNCTION is called with one parameter: the selected candidate.

  An action other than the default can be chosen from this list
  of actions for the currently selected candidate (by default
  with TAB). The DISPLAY string is shown in the completions
  buffer and the FUNCTION is invoked when an action is
  selected. The first action of the list is the default.")

(helm-document-attribute 'coerce "optional"
  "  It's a function called with one argument: the selected candidate.

  This function is intended for type convertion.
  In normal case, the selected candidate (string) is passed to action function.
  If coerce function is specified, it is called just before action function.

  Example: converting string to symbol

(helm-document-attribute 'type "optional if action attribute is provided"
  "  Indicates the type of the items the source returns.

  Merge attributes not specified in the source itself from
  `helm-type-attributes'.

  This attribute is implemented by plug-in.")

(helm-document-attribute 'init "optional"
  "  Function called with no parameters when helm is started. It
  is useful for collecting current state information which can be
  used to create the list of candidates later.

  For example, if a source needs to work with the current
  directory then it can store its value here, because later
  helm does its job in the minibuffer and in the
  `helm-buffer' and the current directory can be different
  there.")

(helm-document-attribute 'delayed-init "optional"
  "  Function called with no parameters before candidate function is
  called.  It is similar with `init' attribute, but its
  evaluation is deferred. It is useful to combine with ")

(helm-document-attribute 'match "optional"
  "  List of functions called with one parameter: a candidate. The
  function should return non-nil if the candidate matches the
  current pattern (see variable `helm-pattern').

  This attribute allows the source to override the default
  pattern matching based on `string-match'. It can be used, for
  example, to implement a source for file names and do the
  pattern matching on the basename of files, since it's more
  likely one is typing part of the basename when searching for a
  file, instead of some string anywhere else in its path.

  If the list contains more than one function then the list of
  matching candidates from the source is constructed by appending
  the results after invoking the first function on all the
  potential candidates, then the next function, and so on. The
  matching candidates supplied by the first function appear first
  in the list of results and then results from the other
  functions, respectively.

  This attribute has no effect for asynchronous sources (see
  attribute `candidates'), since they perform pattern matching
  themselves.")

(helm-document-attribute 'candidate-transformer "optional"
  "  It's a function or a list of functions called with one argument
  when the completion list from the source is built. The argument
  is the list of candidates retrieved from the source. The
  function should return a transformed list of candidates which
  will be used for the actual completion.  If it is a list of
  functions, it calls each function sequentially.

  This can be used to transform or remove items from the list of
  candidates.

  Note that `candidates' is run already, so the given transformer
  function should also be able to handle candidates with (DISPLAY
  . REAL) format.")

(helm-document-attribute 'filtered-candidate-transformer "optional"
  "  It has the same format as `candidate-transformer', except the
  function is called with two parameters: the candidate list and
  the source.

  This transformer is run on the candidate list which is already
  filtered by the current pattern. While `candidate-transformer'
  is run only once, it is run every time the input pattern is
  changed.

  It can be used to transform the candidate list dynamically, for
  example, based on the current pattern.

  In some cases it may also be more efficent to perform candidate
  transformation here, instead of with `candidate-transformer'
  even if this transformation is done every time the pattern is
  changed.  For example, if a candidate set is very large then
  `candidate-transformer' transforms every candidate while only
  some of them will actually be dislpayed due to the limit
  imposed by `helm-candidate-number-limit'.

  Note that `candidates' and `candidate-transformer' is run
  already, so the given transformer function should also be able
  to handle candidates with (DISPLAY . REAL) format.

  This option has no effect for asynchronous sources. (Not yet,
  at least.")

(helm-document-attribute 'action-transformer "optional"
  "  It's a function or a list of functions called with two
  arguments when the action list from the source is
  assembled. The first argument is the list of actions, the
  second is the current selection.  If it is a list of functions,
  it calls each function sequentially.

  The function should return a transformed action list.

  This can be used to customize the list of actions based on the
  currently selected candidate.")

(helm-document-attribute 'pattern-transformer "optional"
  "  It's a function or a list of functions called with one argument
  before computing matches. Its argument is `helm-pattern'.
  Functions should return transformed `helm-pattern'.

  It is useful to change interpretation of `helm-pattern'.")

(helm-document-attribute 'delayed "optional"
  "  Candidates from the source are shown only if the user stops
  typing and is idle for `helm-idle-delay' seconds.
  If a value is given to delayed attr, this value is used instead only
  if it is > to `helm-idle-delay'.")

(helm-document-attribute 'volatile "optional"
  "  Indicates the source assembles the candidate list dynamically,
  so it shouldn't be cached within a single Helm
  invocation. It is only applicable to synchronous sources,
  because asynchronous sources are not cached.")

(helm-document-attribute 'requires-pattern "optional"
  "  If present matches from the source are shown only if the
  pattern is not empty. Optionally, it can have an integer
  parameter specifying the required length of input which is
  useful in case of sources with lots of candidates.")

(helm-document-attribute 'persistent-action "optional"
  "Can be a either a Function called with one parameter (the selected candidate)

   to not split his window to execute this persistent action.")

(helm-document-attribute 'candidates-in-buffer "optional"
  "  Shortcut attribute for making and narrowing candidates using
  buffers.  This newly-introduced attribute prevents us from
  forgetting to add volatile and match attributes.

  (candidates-in-buffer) is equivalent of three attributes:

  This function converts point of line-beginning and point of line-end,

  The function transforms the selected candidate, and the result
  is passed to the action function.  The display-to-real
  attribute provides another way to pass other string than one
  shown in Helm buffer.

  Traditionally, it is possible to make candidates,
  candidate-transformer or filtered-candidate-transformer
  function return a list with (DISPLAY . REAL) pairs. But if REAL
  can be generated from DISPLAY, display-to-real is more
  convenient and faster.")

(helm-document-attribute 'real-to-display "optional"
  "  Function called with one parameter; the selected candidate.

  The inverse of display-to-real attribute.

  The function transforms the selected candidate, which is passed
  to the action function, for display.  The real-to-display
  attribute provides the other way to pass other string than one
  shown in Helm buffer.

  Traditionally, it is possible to make candidates,
  candidate-transformer or filtered-candidate-transformer
  function return a list with (DISPLAY . REAL) pairs. But if
  DISPLAY can be generated from REAL, real-to-display is more
  convenient.

  Note that DISPLAY parts returned from candidates /
  candidate-transformer are IGNORED as the name `display-to-real'
  says.")

(helm-document-attribute 'cleanup "optional"
  "  Function called with no parameters when *helm* buffer is closed. It
  is useful for killing unneeded candidates buffer.

(helm-document-attribute 'help-message "optional"
  "  Help message for this source.
  If not present, `helm-help-message' value will be used.")

(helm-document-attribute 'match-part "optional"
  "  Allow matching candidate in the line with `candidates-in-buffer'.
In candidates-in-buffer sources, match is done with `re-search-forward'
which allow matching only a regexp on the `helm-buffer'; when this search is
done, match-part allow matching only a specific part of the current line e.g
with a line like this:

filename:candidate-containing-the-word-filename

What you want is to ignore \"filename\" part and match only
\"candidate-containing-the-word-filename\" 

So give a function matching only the part of candidate after \":\"

If source contain match-part attribute, match is computed only
on part of candidate returned by the call of function provided
